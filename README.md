This event and circumstance has been deemed "The Silver Tsunami." With one third of the company work force potentially retiring, we needed to come up with a plan.
This brings up the idea of the mentorship program

# Mentorship Eligibility

With that being said, out of the 72,458 retirees, only 1,549 are eligible for the mentorship program.

To replace (essentially) 70,949 employees with a new generation for Pewlett Hackard, the Mentors would need to take on 45-46 new employees EACH. This is unrealistic to train an entire new generation of employees for Pewlett hackard. 

# Results 

- There are 72,458 employees eligible for retirement at Pewlett Hackard, and a total of 240,124 Employees (the Silver Tsunami is 30% of the current work force for Pewlett Hackard).
- Mentorship Eligible employees are an extremely small amount compared to how many new employees will need to be hired in. There are 1,549 mentorship eligible individuals, and they would be mentoring ~46 people EACH. (This would be to replace the Silver Tsunami in its entirety).

# Summary

Pewlett Hackard will need to replace 72,458 people, this includes Mentor retirees. There are 1,549 total mentorship eligible retirees, across departments this may be able to be split up well, however, looking at this figure in a general sense, we know that if there were a need to replace ALL 72,458 employees, each mentor would need to take on ~46 mentees. 
One question to ask is, how many employees are retiring from each department, and how many employees need to be hired in to each department respectively, and then go from there.
